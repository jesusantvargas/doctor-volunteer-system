This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Install Node
Begin by [installing] (https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew) Node on your machine.

After Node has been installed, open the `volClient` folder inside your Terminal or command line, and enter `npm install` in order to install all dependencies needed for the project.

After dependencies have been installed, enter `npm start`. This will start the `Client`. The client should now be available via localhost: 3000
